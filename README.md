As the creator of this interactive quiz web page, my goal was to design an engaging, user-friendly, and visually appealing interface that enables users to test their knowledge across a variety of general knowledge topics. The entire project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are foundational web development languages that offer both simplicity and flexibility for building interactive experiences.

Tools and Editor Used
To develop this project, I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my primary code editor. It provides powerful features like syntax highlighting, live server preview, and extensions that significantly streamlined my workflow. For version control, I relied on Git, and the live testing was done in Brave browser due to its robust developer tools.

Structure and Technologies
The project is built using three core web technologies:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was used to structure the content of the quiz, including sections such as the start screen, quiz screen, and end screen.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was responsible for styling and animating the interface. I designed a responsive layout with modern aesthetics using linear gradients, soft shadows, and interactive transitions. Special attention was paid to mobile responsiveness using media queries.

JavaScript handled all the dynamic behaviors, such as loading questions, handling user interactions, displaying feedback, updating the score, and navigating between quiz stages.

Design Approach
The quiz page is organized into three main stages:

Start Screen: Introduces the quiz and includes a “Start Quiz” button.

Quiz Screen: Displays one question at a time, with multiple-choice options. Users receive immediate feedback after answering each question, supported by animated progress bars and a scoring system.

End Screen: Shows the final score, total correct and incorrect answers, accuracy percentage, and a motivational message based on the performance.

Animations and visual feedback were essential in keeping the user engaged. I implemented CSS animations like slideIn, fadeInUp, and pulse to create smooth transitions and improve user experience. Buttons have hover effects, and selected options change color to indicate correct or incorrect answers, providing clear feedback.

Functionality
The quiz uses a simple JavaScript array of objects to store questions, options, correct answers, and explanations. Event listeners track user interaction. Logic for score calculation, answer validation, and feedback display was carefully scripted to ensure the flow is seamless and intuitive.

Accessibility was considered by maintaining sufficient color contrast and font readability. The use of semantic HTML and ARIA-friendly markup ensures that the app is screen-reader compatible.

Conclusion
This web page reflects my passion for front-end development and interactive UI/UX design. By combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a clean and modular fashion, I was able to deliver a lightweight yet powerful educational tool. This project not only sharpens coding skills but also demonstrates how dynamic user interfaces can be created from scratch using vanilla web technologies—without the need for frameworks or libraries. It is suitable for educational platforms, personal learning, or as a portfolio project.
